       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nPart I\\nItem 1. Business\\nOur Company\\nNVIDIA  pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. NVIDIA  is now a full-stack computing infrastructure\\ncompany with data-center-scale of ferings that are reshaping industry .\\nOur full-stac k includes the foundational CUDA  programming model that runs on all NVIDIA  GPUs, as well as hundreds of domain-specific software libraries,\\nsoftware development kits, or SDKs, and Applic ation Programming Interfaces, or APIs. This deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance and\\neases the deployment of NVIDIA  accelerated computing for computationally intensive workl oads such as artificial intelligence, or AI, model training and\\ninference, data analytics , scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimization s to address industries ranging from healthcare and telecom to\\nautomotive and manufacturing.\\nOur data-center-scale offerings are comprised  of compute and networking solutions that can scale to tens of thousands of GPU-accelerated servers\\ninterconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture and scale is needed for the development and deployment of modern\\nAI applications.\\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video  games and films. Today , it also simulates human intelligence,\\nenabling a deeper understanding of the physica l world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep\\nlearning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amoun ts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-\\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and\\nproducts that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new content\\nsuch as text, code, images, audio, video, and molecule structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as\\nproducts, services, media or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user preferences.\\nNVIDIA  has a platform strategy , bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we\\nserve. While  the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and\\nnetworking and software stacks. The programm able nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same\\nunderlying technology by using a variety of softw are stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. The large and growing number\\nof developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $45.3 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern\\ncomputing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA\\nprogramming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way for\\nthe emergence of mode rn AI. In 2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on NVIDIA  GPUs, won the ImageNet computer image recognition competition,\\nmarking the “Big Bang” moment of AI. We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomous\\ndriving syste m-on-chips, or SoC, in 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking and led to the introduction\\nof a new processor class – the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past 5 years, we have built full software stacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA  to\\nbring AI to the world’ s largest industries, including NVIDIA  DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for industrial digitalization;\\nand introduced the NVIDIA  AI Enterprise software – essentially an operating system for enterpr ise AI applications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center\\nCPU, Grace , built for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing. With a strong engineering  culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technology\\ninnovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking, software and algorithms. More than half of our engineers work on software.\\nThe world’ s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale accelerated computing platforms to enable,\\naccelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end users, including AI solutions and assistants, search, recommendations, social networking, online\\nshopping, live video, and translation.\\nEnterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new generative AI-enabled products and services,\\nor to drama tically accelerate and reduce the costs of their workloads and workflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new AI assistants and\\nchatbots; the transportation industry for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for acce lerated and computer-aided drug discovery; and the financial\\nservices industry for customer support and fraud detection.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely\\naffected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will\\ndemand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We\\ncannot ensu re that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success\\ncriteria, our financial results may be harmed.\\nWe have begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA  DGX Cloud services directly and through our network of partners, which include cloud-based\\ninfrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA  AI Founda tions for customizable pretrained AI models. We have partnered\\nwith CSPs to host such software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to\\nsupport these offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to\\nchange, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA  DGX Cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and\\ninvestment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions, including NVIDIA  AI Enterprise, NVIDIA  Omniverse, NVIDIA  DRIVE, and several other\\nsoftware solutions. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services. We\\nmay incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these of ferings.\\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\\nOur target markets rema in competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer\\nneeds, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’  products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K, may be cheaper or provide better function ality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected selling prices\\nfor our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more\\ncomprehensive IP portfolios and patent protecti ons, more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These\\ncompetitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and\\nend-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a\\nsupply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar\\nto some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete\\nwith our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If\\nwe are unable to succe ssfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, service s and technologies could decrease and we may not establish\\nmeaningful revenue.\\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\\nFailure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component\\nand capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter  or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as\\nwe have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and\\nexcess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\\nWe build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-\\nterm supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure suf ficient\\n15', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

These risks may increase as we shorten our\\nproduct development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain\\ncomplexity . Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available\\nfrom third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply\\nor capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead\\ntimes of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and\\nmay continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity ,\\nwhich may require additional deposits. W e may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\\nMany additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products,\\nor otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\\n•changes in product development cycles and time to market;\\n•competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\\n•changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\\n•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\\n•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n•the availability of suf ficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;\\n•new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\\n•new or unexpected end-use cases;\\n•increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\\n•business decisions made by third parties;\\n•the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA  DGX Cloud services;\\n•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\\n•the demand for our products; or\\n•government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\\nDemand for our data center systems and produc ts surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across\\nseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and\\ncapacity purchases with existing suppliers, adde d new vendors and entered into prepaid manu facturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to\\nenter into new supplier and capacity arrangeme nts. Our purchase commitments and obligation s for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal\\nyear 2024 were impacte d by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very\\nstrong. We expect our next-generation products  to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if\\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nOur custom er orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are\\ncomplex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship\\nand support new produc ts. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center ,\\nProfessional Visualizatio n, and Gaming products . We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\\nopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long\\nmanufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of\\nprior architec tures ahead  of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience\\nreduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate\\n16', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

If we are unable to\\nexecute our architectura l transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of\\nnewly introd uced produc ts may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other\\ncosts or result in produc t delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has\\nimpacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and\\nhave previously sold multiple product architectu res at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our\\nsupply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly throu gh multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and\\nother channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in\\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability\\nto properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production\\nand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may\\nnot be able to do so in a timely manner , or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand\\nor otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’  orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relatio nships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market\\nshare and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability\\nissues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may\\nnot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may\\nneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to\\ncontinue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our\\nhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may\\ncontinue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total\\nsupply . All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA  DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA  AI Foundations,\\nOmniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases , applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility\\nin our revenue or supply  levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies,\\nsuch as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our\\nproducts may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI\\nmodels on our reported  revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally , we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper\\nSuperchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if\\nwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to\\nour supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future\\nimpact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to\\nbe used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of\\ncryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in\\nthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0\\nmerge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\\naftermarket sales of our\\n17\", metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

In general, our new products or previously sold products\\nmay be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces\\ncompete with our new products and distribution channels.\\nAdditionally , we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our\\nplatforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by\\ndevelopers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers\\nor publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect\\ncustomer demand.\\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product\\nquantity and quality , manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.\\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipm ent and techniques. We do not assemble, test, or package our\\nproducts, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and\\nproducts. We face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain,\\nnegatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial\\nresults, including:\\n•lack of guaranteed supp ly of wafer , component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly\\nestimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with suf ficient quantities or in a timely manner;\\n•failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adeq uate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our\\nproducts;\\n•failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry\\nprocess technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;\\n•failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\\n•limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers and memory\\nmanufacturers;\\n•loss of a supplier and additional expense and/o r production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume\\nproduction or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;\\n•lack of direct control over product quantity , quality and delivery schedules;\\n•suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;\\n•delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrea se in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our\\ncompetitors’  or other customers’  orders over ours;\\n•requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;\\n•low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’ s proprietary process technology; and\\n•disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes, fires, or other natural disasters and\\nelectricity conservation ef forts.\\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause us\\nto lose market share.\\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex.

Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally\\nremain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the\\npast and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could\\nresult in loss of data or intangible property , or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that\\ncould attack our product s or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specification s could lead to substantial damage to the products in which our\\nofferings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs , AIBs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any\\nsuch defect may cause us to incur significant warranty , support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-of f the value of\\nrelated inven tory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our\\nefforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after\\ncommencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a\\nproduct or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’  perceptions of our brand, which would in\\nturn negativ ely impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or\\nconsumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory\\nagencies.\\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other\\ndefects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods.\\nWe recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty\\nobligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of\\nour products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party , such as within our supply chain, the cost of\\ndefending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further , our business\\nliability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy ,\\ndisruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses,\\nincluding on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints and\\nglobal economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial\\nresults, including:\\n•increased costs for wafers, components, logistic s, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and\\nmay do so in the future;\\n•increased supply, employee, facilities and infras tructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce\\nour margins;\\n•decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\\n•the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’  or our licensees’  inability to supply products to customers\\nand/or end users;\\n•limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\\n•the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing parties or other third parties we rely on;\\n•reduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit business es, file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease\\noperations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete\\neffectively; and\\n•increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capit al markets, reduced liquidity , adverse impacts on our\\ncustomers and suppliers, failures of counterpar ties, including financial institutions and insurers , asset impairments, and declines in the value of our\\nfinancial instruments.\\n19', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

Althou gh we have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China, we have started to ship alternatives to the China market in\\nsmall volum es. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing\\nrequirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 . The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of\\nrisks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations. These include domestic and intern ational economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do\\nbusiness, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment\\npractices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations,\\nnatural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.\\nProduct, system security , and data protecti on breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue,\\nincrease our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures,\\nloss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully\\ndetect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.\\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent\\nand severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is\\ndelayed or not feasible.\\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged\\nand are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally , some actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated\\nattacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened\\nrisk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional\\nmisconduct by employees, contractors or other  third-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees,\\ncontractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control\\nmechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incide nts arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information\\nor adhere to our security  policies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events  have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can\\nbe no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party\\nsuppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology ,\\nemployee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and\\ninfrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’  supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or\\nbugs that could result in a breach of or disrupt ion to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information\\ntechnology systems that support our services.  We may also incorporate third-party data into our AI algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our\\nalgorithms. These datasets may be flawed, insuf ficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents. We may\\nhave limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’\\ninformation security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers\\nsuffers a security incident (which has happened in the\\n20', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\npast and may happen in the future), our respon se may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other\\ninformation related to the security incident. Additionally , we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our\\nproducts or services are compromised, a signific ant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm\\nour business.\\nTo defend against secur ity incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to\\nresult in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed\\nto ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable\\nindustry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate\\ncertain vulne rabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls,\\nsystems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a\\nsecurity incident has occurred. Further , we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.\\nThese vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.\\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures,\\nalong with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary inform ation or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties,\\ncould expos e us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability , regulatory\\ninquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code\\nfrom third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of\\nloss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA  to potential litigation and liability . If we or a third party we rely on\\nexperience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse\\nconsequences, includin g government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements  and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation,\\nindemnification obligatio ns, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our\\nsystems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders,\\ndelayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. Applicable\\ndata privacy  and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, includin g affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of\\nsecurity incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity . In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may\\ngather , collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\\norganization and could be used to harm our business.\\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather cond itions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures,\\nsupplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory\\ndeterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity ,\\nand a portio n of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of\\nour suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in\\nthese geogra phical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research\\nand develop ment systems and personnel. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plann ing may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Geopolitical and\\ndomestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally . Political instability , changes in government or\\nadverse political develo pments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our\\nproduct components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in chan ging regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could\\nimpact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability . For example, other countries have restricted\\nand may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and\\ncompanies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or\\nother operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology system\\nfailures or cyber-attacks,  military actions or economic, business, labor , environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party\\nfoundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster , war or catastrophic event\\naffects us, the third-party  systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses,\\nand substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and\\noperating results.\\n21', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

Our operating\\nexpenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity . We believe our global supply chain for our\\nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further , in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region\\nhave been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly , some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others\\nmay continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operatio ns. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to\\nour business; however , if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our\\nbusiness.\\nAdditionally , interruptions  or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the events\\ndescribed above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As\\nwe increase our reliance  on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages\\nand other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy . Power or water shortages, or\\nregulations that limit energy or water availability , could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and\\nservices.\\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and\\nreliability in the regions where we conduct busin ess is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme\\nheat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for\\nour Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively . Climate change, its impact\\non our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our\\nvendors do business, may disrupt our business  and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we\\nmaintain insurance coverage for a variety of property , casualty , and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and\\ncost. Some of our polici es have large deductibl es and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not\\ncovered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\\nOur busines s and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulations\\nrelating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in\\ngreater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes,\\nincreased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as\\nwell as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additiona l compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and\\nrestrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\\nStakeholder groups may find us insuf ficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We\\nmay not achieve our stated sustainability-related  goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals.\\nWe may also experienc e contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased\\nlitigation and costs.\\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by concerns\\naround the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing\\nplatforms.\\nWe may not be able to realize the potential  benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate\\nacquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or\\nenhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop\\nnew products or sell our products and ultimately  could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our\\nability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to\\ndelays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the\\ntarget company , technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other chan ges can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits\\nof the transaction and negatively impact our business.

Further , our investm ents in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our\\nresults and may generat e losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our\\nstrategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction.\\nMany of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return.\\nTo the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our\\ninvestment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We\\nface addition al risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’ s attention;\\ndifficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition  or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining\\ngovernmental, regulator y approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financin g; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or\\ninvestment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are\\nacquiring.\\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\\n•difficulty in integrating the technology , systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key\\npersonnel, of the acquired business;\\n•assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\\n•integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\\n•coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\\n•stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm  if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an\\nacquisition;\\n•potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or\\nother restrictions;\\n•the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\\n•the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\\n•negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\\n•exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\\n•impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’ s employees, vendors and customers.\\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and\\ncostly systems integration, delays in purchasing  and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes\\nwith our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integra tion personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of\\noperations and may continue to do so in the future.\\nWe receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to\\ncustomers who purchase directly or indirectl y from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of\\nthese customers.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to one customer , Customer\\nA, represent ed 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these channel partners,\\nwe are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operatin g results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as\\nthe ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to\\nincorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order\\nbasis, our customers can generally cancel, chan ge or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty . Our partners or customers\\nmay develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in\\nthe markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’  purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not\\npurchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners.

If end demand  increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators,\\ndistributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of\\nour large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’  trade restrictions or any\\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\\nTo be comp etitive and execute our business strategy successfully , we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and\\ndevelop capable and diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’ s highly competitive market for skilled\\nworkers and leaders, cost inflation and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigrati on and work permit regulations or in their administration or\\ninterpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-\\nbased compensation, and in times of stock price volatility , as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-\\nbased compensation may decrease. Additional ly, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective\\nsuccession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution\\nand long-term success.\\nOur busines s is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such\\nsystems may disrupt our business, and internal controls.\\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions , including our assessment of internal controls over financial\\nreporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarb anes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our\\ngrowth. We continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system\\nimplementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully\\noperate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose\\nsubstantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our\\noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial\\nstatements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any\\nmaterial weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results\\non a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be\\nsubject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities\\nanalysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on our\\npast results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could af fect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\\n•our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\\n•our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\\n•our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some custom ers to make required payments, our ability to obtain\\ncredit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-of fs;\\n•our vendors' payment requirements;\\n•unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\\n•changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\\nAny of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have granted and may continue to grant\\nextended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have\\nrequested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have\\navailable for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creating\\nvolatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is\\nlikely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility .\\n24\", metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

Compliance with such\\nrequirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to\\nmanufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors , suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws\\nor the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions\\nagainst us, our officers, or our employees, prohib itions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations\\nto which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further\\nrestrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result\\nof changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.\\nOur position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,\\nthe United Kingdom and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the\\ngraphics card and cloud service provider market  as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received requests for information\\nfrom regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply , foundation models and our\\ninvestments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in\\nthe future. Governments  and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardwar e, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation\\nmodels and generative AI. If implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new\\nsystems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws\\nor regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or\\ntariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing\\nof our shipments. Additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our\\nbusiness and results of operations.\\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or\\nother trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export\\nlicense with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’ s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),\\nand generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or\\nsanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U .S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available\\nunder the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nFor example , in response to the war in Ukrain e, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which\\nblocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to\\nRussia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently , the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA  and may continue to do so in the future.\\nThe increasi ng focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of\\nenabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service of ferings.\\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,\\nmodels, and solutions, has resulted in and could  in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,\\ntuning, and deploying LLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire,\\ndeploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to AI technologies.\\nAs geopolitic al tensions have increased, semic onductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export\\ncontrol restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies.

Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and\\napplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively\\nimpact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and\\ncould negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,\\nwhich have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even\\nthough comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial\\nresults. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products\\nto additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively\\nimpact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and\\ncustomers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\\nExport contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China\\nand for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our\\nproducts, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to\\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting\\nour business and financ ial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.\\nAdditional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and\\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve\\noverseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our\\nproducts and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our\\nsales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators\\nconclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions\\non our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nDuring the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and\\nsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,\\nDGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated\\ncircuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in\\nChina. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to\\nthe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\\nincluding China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,\\nH800, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and\\nHong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution\\noperations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,\\nincluding those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered\\nby the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG\\nwill grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome\\nconditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have\\nclear standards or an opportunity for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of\\nproducts to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for\\ncountries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\\n26', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\ndisadvantage NVIDIA  against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their\\nproducts.\\nManagement of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive\\nposition and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes  in the USG’ s export controls, including further expansion of the\\ngeographic, customer , or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we\\nare unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to\\nsignificant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose\\nburdensome conditions that we or our customers  or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors,\\nas the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to\\npursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time\\nand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the\\nevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG\\nhas already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license\\nconditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking  and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if\\ncertain syste m or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such\\ncontrols to restrict addit ional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supp ly and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such\\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our\\nproducts, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact\\ndemand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-\\nspeed netwo rk interconn ects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider\\nrange of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvant age us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are\\noutside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other\\nimpacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to\\nserve marke ts worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that\\nour customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,\\nexcessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and service s not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe,\\nLatin Americ a, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the\\ntime a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase\\ninvestment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\\nAdditionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\\nrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platfo rm companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions\\non the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese\\ngovernment announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain produ cts made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on\\nour products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\\nFinally , our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that\\nnegatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regula tors and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks\\nand adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investm ent funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and government regulators have focused\\nincreasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be\\nsatisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further , there is an increasing number of state-level initiatives in the\\nU.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’  expectatio ns.

We could also incur\\nadditional costs and require additional resources  to monitor , report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct business\\nwith potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm our brand,\\nreputation and business activities or expose us to liability .\\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability .\\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm\\nand liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly buildin g AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and\\nservices, and we also offer stand-alone AI applic ations. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethic al issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its\\nadoption, and therefore our business. If we enab le or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society , such as AI solutions\\nthat have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity , or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy , employment or\\nother social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policie s and frameworks relating to the responsible development and\\nuse of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability . Complying\\nwith multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain\\njurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with\\nexisting and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in\\nresponse to the Biden administration’ s Executive  Order on AI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting\\nand/or trans parency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive  Order on AI could require us to notify the USG of certain safety\\ntest results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change\\nour business  practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequate ly address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible\\nuse of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful\\nor if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringem ent or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties\\nthat we have agreed to indemnify . An unfavorab le ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties,\\npayment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claim s that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur\\nsignificant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the ef forts and attention of management and technical personnel.\\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operatin g expenses. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If\\ninfringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’ s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the\\nthird party’ s IP rights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities\\nor have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross\\nlicense our technology . If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore,\\nthe indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in\\nwhich we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of\\npiracy of our technology and products more likely . The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm\\nour competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development and\\nmarketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek\\nformal prote ction for existing and new innovation s and technologies but cannot be certain wheth er our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if\\napproved, whether they will be enforceable.\\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations.

The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could\\nresult in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal\\nclaims.\\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal\\ndata privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states have enacted  comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on\\ncovered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As\\napplicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as\\ntargeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and\\nservices. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy\\nimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by\\nthe California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional\\nviolation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\\nand local levels. Addition ally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products\\nand services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also consid ering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted\\nthe General Data Protec tion Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of\\npersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively , including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose\\ndata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply , we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or\\n4% of worldwide revenue , whichever is greater , and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to\\nchange our business practices.\\nIn the ordina ry course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain\\njurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of\\npersonal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly\\ntransfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdi ctions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the\\nUnited States. Additionally , the U.K.’ s Internatio nal Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K.\\nextension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify  compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms\\nthat may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However , these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is\\nno assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are\\nconsidering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of\\ndoing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’ s law impose s various requirements relating to data processing and data\\nlocalization. Data broadly defined as important under China’ s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment\\nand approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these require ments, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of\\nsuch assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The\\ninability to import person al data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties\\nthat are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe\\nand/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly\\nviolating the GDPR’ s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligation s related to data privacy and security , and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or\\nmay be claim ed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual\\nrestrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal\\ndata, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action,  or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and\\nother statem ents, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security . If these policies, materials or\\nstatements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency , deceptive, unfair or misreprese ntative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation,\\nenforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\\n29', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",

These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and\\npractices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with\\nsuch obligat ions. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant\\nconsequences, including  but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing\\npersonal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial\\ncondition.\\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected\\ntax rates and other tax-related factors.\\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\\ndetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although\\nwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes\\nimposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\\nFurther , changes in tax laws or their interpretat ion by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other\\nadverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United\\nStates, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible  income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction\\nis reduced, our provision  for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of\\nforeign jurisd ictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Pillar Two Model Rules\\nannounced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by\\ncountries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely af fect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.\\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affecte d by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries\\nwith differing  statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiratio n of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles,\\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductibl e for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business\\ncombinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our busines s and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for\\nstock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur . A decline in our stock\\nprice may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our ef fective tax rate and adversely af fect our financial results.\\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings,  claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder ,\\nconsumer , competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defend ing a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders\\nasserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency\\nmining on GPU demand  in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur , including monetary\\ndamages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other\\nremedies, such as compulsory licensing of paten ts. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact.

Risk Factors”, our\\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. \\nOverview\\nOur Company and Our Businesses\\nNVIDIA  pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA  has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated\\ncomputing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,\\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA  was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply , Product T ransitions, and New Products and Business Models\\nDemand for our data center systems and produc ts surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across\\nseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and\\ncapacity purchases with existing suppliers, adde d new vendors and entered into prepaid manu facturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase\\ncommitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain\\ncomponents. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains\\nvery strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or\\nimpairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nWe build finished produc ts and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments,\\nwe may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These\\nrisks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain,\\ncreating additional supply chain complexity .\\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simul taneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and\\nsupport new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center ,\\nProfessional Visualizatio n, and Gaming products . We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\\nopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associat ed with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing\\nlead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures\\nahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products\\ncould result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new\\nproducts to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of\\ncustomer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures\\nat the same time, these transitions are dif ficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA  DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform,\\nLLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or\\nsupply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as\\ngenerative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown.\\n34', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nGlobal T rade\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong\\nKong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to\\nthe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\\nincluding China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,\\nH800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,\\nincluding those for which  the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market\\nin small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing\\nrequirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the\\nlicensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the\\nlicense application in a timely manner or at all.\\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in\\nthe USG’s export contro ls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitic al tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the\\nexport contr ol rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our\\nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our invento ry of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the\\nMiddle East.\\nWhile we work to enhan ce the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors\\n– Risks Related to Regulatory , Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\\nMacroeconomic Factors\\nMacroeconomic factors, including\\u2009inflation, increa sed interest rates, capital market volatility , global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical\\ndevelopments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify ,\\nthese macro economic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our\\ninvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously\\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors.\\u2009\\nIsrael and Hamas Conflict\\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700\\nemployees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating\\nexpenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity . We believe our global supply chain for our\\nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further , in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region\\nhave been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly , some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others\\nmay continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operatio ns. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to\\nour business; however , if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our\\nbusiness.\\n35', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

As AV\\nalgorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA ’s automotive data center processing demand to grow\\nsignificantly . We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large\\ncloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers. We announced NVIDIA\\nSpectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI.\\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $10.4 billion, up 15% from fiscal year 2023. In Gaming, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and 4070 GPUs based on\\nthe NVIDIA  Ada Lovelac e architecture.

The\\npreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of\\nrevenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation\\nuncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories,\\nrevenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.\\nInventories\\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions  to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory , and\\nfor excess product purch ase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels\\nand future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete  inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions,\\nchanges in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and\\ncustomer requirements, new product introduction s resulting in less demand for existing products  or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer\\ndemand properly , orderi ng in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for\\ncompetitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory .\\nThe net effect on our gross margin from invento ry provisions and sales of items previously writte n down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024\\nand 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-\\nparty manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months\\nfor some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product compone nts in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and\\nprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity . We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\\nIncome T axes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and\\njudgments and involves dealing with uncertaintie s in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting stand ards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we\\noperate, or changes in other facts or circumstan ces. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\\nestimate of whether , and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\\naccordingly .\\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively , related to capital loss carryforwards, and\\ncertain state  and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets\\nas income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\n37\", metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue Allowances\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on histor ical return rates. However , if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking\\ndistributors for specific products are contractuall y limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\\nWe account for customer programs, which involv e rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on\\nthe amount we expect to be claimed by custo mers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific\\nproducts and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentiv es will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals\\ninclude a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\\nperiod, we measure progress to completion base d on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.\\nEstimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may conta in more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer\\ncontract is distinct. Exce pt for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA  products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a\\nsignificant amount of integration or interdepende ncy. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple perfor mance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\\nprice basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately , we\\ndetermine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property , plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\\nestimated useful life of a majority of the server , storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test\\nequipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of\\nrevenue and operating expenses, respectively , which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or\\n$0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\\nResults of Operations\\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below .

The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2024\\nand 2023.\\nSales and arrangements  with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate\\nfluctuations.

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits\\nof controls must be considered relative to their costs.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered  with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit s in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated finan cial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those  risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of recor ds that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate beca use of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n48\", metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below , providing a separate opinion on the\\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory\\nfor excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’ s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of\\nproducts, based on the Company’ s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market\\nconditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Compa ny’s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the Company’ s consolidated outstanding inventory\\npurchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\\nThe principal considerations for our determinati on that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or\\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing\\nprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and\\nmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant  auditor judgment, subjectivity , and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’ s assumptions\\nrelated to future demand and market conditions.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing proce dures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’ s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess\\nproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management’ s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\\nincluded, among others, testing management’ s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\\ncommitments; evaluating  the appropriateness of management’ s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and\\nevaluating the reasonableness of management’ s assumptions related to future demand and mark et conditions. Evaluating management’ s assumptions related to\\nfuture demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past\\nresults, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology .\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nFebruary 21, 2024\\nWe have served as the Company’ s auditor since 2004.\\n49', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOur Company\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA  was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA  Corporation and its subsidiaries.\\nFiscal Year\\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year , ending on the last Sunday in January . Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA  Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and\\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of finan cial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\\nand expense s during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimat es. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including\\nthose related to revenue  recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income\\ntaxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restru cturing and other charges, property , plant, and equipment, and\\nother contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property , plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\\nestimated useful life of most of our server , storage, and network equipment from three  to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to\\nseven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating\\nexpenses, respectively , which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and\\ndiluted share.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, includ ing hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We\\ndetermine revenue recognition through the follow ing steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\\nthe contract; (3) determ ination of the transaction  price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is\\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance\\nobligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\\nProduct Sales Revenue\\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in\\nexchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support\\nand extended warranty revenue are recognized  ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for\\nreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on histor ical return rates. However , if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\\nOur custome r programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing\\ndevelopment funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our\\npartners’  activities while  also promoting NVIDIA  products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for\\npotential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\\n55', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nOur license and develo pment arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the\\nrevenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services\\nare performe d. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each\\nproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\\nSoftware Licensing\\nOur softwar e licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer . Customers may purchase either\\nperpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are\\nfrequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspec ified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software\\nlicenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer . Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or\\nas services are performed.\\nCloud Services\\nCloud servic es, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided\\non a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\\ncontract period. Revenu e related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occu rs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but\\ncertain of ferings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance\\nobligation. We account for multiple agreements  with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements\\nindicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in ef fect, parts of a single contract.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple perfor mance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\\nprice basis. The standal one selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific produ ct or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances\\nand to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\\nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\\nProduct W arranties\\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware\\ncomponent failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited  warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a\\nloss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,\\nor RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of\\ngrant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions , or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs\\nand market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs\\nis recognized using an accelerated amortization  model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP ,\\nusing the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and Septe mber of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP  is\\nexpensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally , for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and\\nrevise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures dif fer from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\\nWe currently , are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and\\nother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, comm ercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\\nparties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions\\n56', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nor other third-party claim s against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes\\navailable that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the\\nloss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP . Howeve r, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be\\nmaterially dif ferent from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars\\nat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, exce pt for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet\\namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated\\nStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\\nIncome T axes\\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax\\njurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary\\ndifferences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available\\nevidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\\nOur calculation of deferr ed tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgmen ts and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of\\ncomplex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,\\nchanges in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we\\nrecognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign  income tax contingencies based on our estima te of whether , and the extent to which, additional taxes may be\\ndue. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to\\nrecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly .\\nAs of January 28, 2024,  we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent\\nrealization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is\\ncomputed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outsta nding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any\\nanti-dilutive ef fect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nWe consider  all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be\\ncash equiva lents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently\\nclassify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale\\ndebt securities are repor ted at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component\\nof shareholders’  equity , net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes  accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of\\nmarketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated\\nStatements of Income.\\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review . If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its\\namortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is\\nmore likely than not we will be required or\\n57', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nwe intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income\\n(expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nFair V alue of Financial Instruments\\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short\\nmaturities as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with\\nthe related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’  equity , net of tax. Fair value\\nof the marke table securi ties is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments  are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured\\nat fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For\\nderivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting\\nlosses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when\\nthe hedged exposure is recognized in earning s. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in\\nearnings.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist prima rily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts\\nreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and\\nincludes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’  financial condition and maintain an allowance for\\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall\\nestimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\\nInventories\\nInventory cost is compu ted on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist\\nprimarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly , testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We\\ncharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory , and for\\nexcess product purchase  commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-of f or written-down, it creates a\\nnew cost basis for the inventory that is not subse quently written-up. We record a liability for nonc ancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in\\nexcess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory .\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method\\nbased on the estimated  useful lives of the assets of three  to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\\naccumulated depreciatio n or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Lease hold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases\\nare amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\\nLeases\\nWe determin e if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease  terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease\\nassets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our\\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remainin g lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing\\nrate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to\\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasona bly certain that we will exercise that option.

       " Document(page_content=\"Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In completing\\nour impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. \\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors af fecting the reporting units.\\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market\\nvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and\\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded comp anies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic\\nfactors and the future profitability of our business. \\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under\\ntechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a\\nmethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are cons umed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably\\ndetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortizatio n, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount  of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and\\nused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by\\nthe asset or asset group . If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimate d future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the\\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately\\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no\\nlonger be depreciated.\\nBusiness Combination\\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired , liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on\\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values  of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded\\nas goodwill. Management’ s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently\\nuncertain and subject to refinement. The estima tes and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of\\nprojected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurem ent period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may\\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated\\nStatements of Income.\\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\\nOur investment in non-a ffiliates consists of mark etable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments\\nin privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense),\\nnet. Non-ma rketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do not have readily\\ndeterminable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly\\ntransactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer , or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive\\nmarket and the valuation requires our judgment  due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity . All gains and losses on these investments,\\nrealized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternative\\nbased on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value\\nand record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\n59\", metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 58}),\n",

The amount is classified as a long-term liability , or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for\\nincome taxes during a period beyond a year .\\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income  tax expense. We recognized net interest and penalties related\\nto unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line of our consolidated statements of income of $42 million, $33 million, and $14 million during fiscal\\nyears 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively . As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, we have accrued $140 million and $95 million, respectively , for the\\npayment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.\\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provid ed for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.\\nAccordingly , our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the\\nunderlying matters are settled or otherwise resol ved. As of January 28, 2024, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total\\namounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.\\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 28, 2024, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be\\nsubject to examination include the United States for fiscal years after 2020, as well as China, Germany , Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, and the United\\nKingdom for fiscal years 2005 through 2023.

During fiscal\\nyear 2024, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for $9.7 billion. As of January  28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications,\\nto repurchas e additional  shares of our common stock up to $22.5 billion. From January 29, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we repurchased 2.8 million shares\\nfor $1.9 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading  plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue\\nadditional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\\nDuring fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, we paid $395 million, $398 million, and $399 million  in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively . Our cash\\ndividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend\\nprogram and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\\nIn fiscal year 2022, we retired our existing 349 million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement.\\nThe excess of repurchas e price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-\\nin capital by $20 million and retained earnings by $12.0 billion.

It shall be binding and enforceable against\\nall Covered Of ficers and, to the extent required by the Compensation Recovery Rules, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\\nrepresentatives.\\nThis Policy amends and restates the Prior Polic y with respect to all Incentive Compensation that is Received by a Covered Officer on and after the Effective\\nDate. The Prior Policy shall continue to apply to Incentive Compensation Received by a Covered Of ficer prior to the Ef fective Date.\\nPolicy Statement | Responsibilities\\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, regardless of whether or when any restated financial statements are filed, the Company must reasonably promptly\\nrecover the full amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, regardless of whether the Covered Of ficer engaged in any misconduct and regardless of\\nfault.\\nFor any compensation plans or programs involving Incentive Compensation, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall include the amount\\ncontributed to any notional account based on Recoverable Incentive Compensation and any earnings to date on that notional amount. For any Incentive\\nCompensation that is based on stock price or TSR, where the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation\\ndirectly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the\\neffect of the Accounting Restatement on the applicable stock price or TSR. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable\\nestimate and provide it to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\\nThe Company would not be required to recover Recoverable Incentive Compensation if (I) (A) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this\\nPolicy would exceed the amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, or (B) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company , to fail to meet the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(13) or 41 1(a) and regulations\\nthereunder and (II) the Committee (or in the absence of a Committee, a majority of the independent members of the Board) determines that recovery would be\\nimpracticable. However , before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation based on expense of\\nenforcement under (I)(A) of this paragraph, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Recoverable Incentive Compensation, document its\\nreasonable attempt(s) to recover , and provide that documentation to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law , the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine the timing and method for recovering Recoverable Incentive\\nCompensation, provided that the recovery is undertaken reasonably promptly . The Committee may , but is not limited to, seek recovery from a Covered Of ficer\\nfrom any or a combination of the following sources, irrespective of whether the applicable source of compensation was approved, awarded, granted, payable or\\npaid to the Covered Of ficer prior to, on, or after the Ef fective Date: (i) direct repayment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation previously paid to the Covered\\nOfficer; (ii) cancelling or directing the return of prior cash or equity-based awards (whether vested or unvested and whether paid or unpaid); (iii) cancelling or\\noffsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards; (iv) forfeiture of any deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A;\\nand (v) any other method authorized by applicable\\nNVIDIA Corporation    Application: Global\\nDocument Name: Compensation Recovery Policy - External            \\nPage 1 of 5', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 91}),\n",

In fiscal year 2023, we increased the\\npercentage of our total electricity use matched by renewable energy purchases to 44%. By fiscal year 2026, we aim to engage manufacturing suppliers\\ncomprising at least 67% of NVIDIA ’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with goal of ef fecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is\\nimportant in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-accelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for\\nmany worklo ads because it is optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by\\nour continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-ef ficient systems. We powered 24 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including\\nthe top supercomputer , on the Green500 list.\\nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA  AI and NVIDIA  Omniverse platform s.

The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies\\nrelating to human capital management.\\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully , we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives,\\nscientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staf f.\\nRecruitment\\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in attracting top talent\\nto NVIDIA. We have attracted talent globally through our strong employer brand and differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership\\ntalent. Our workforce is 83% technical and 49% hold advanced degrees. Additionally , we have increased focus on diversity recruiting, resulting in an increase in\\nglobal femal e hiring in each channel. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 40% of our new hires in fiscal year 2024 coming from employee\\nreferrals.\\nDevelopment and Retention\\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training  courses, targeted development programs, mentoring and peer\\ncoaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums.\\nWe create learning paths focused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to\\nthe most current conten t and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications.\\nWe implemented a career coaching service to provide one-on-one guidance to employees,  and encourage internal job mobility . We have implemented\\nspecifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread\\nreadiness for future advancement.\\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engageme nt, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain\\ninsight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that we can take targeted action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive\\ntool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the\\nidentity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime.

Compliance with environmental sustainability regulations is crucial for maintaining a good reputation, avoiding legal issues, and meeting stakeholder expectations. Failing to comply with these regulations can result in financial penalties and reputational harm.\\n\\n3. Changes in regulations related to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, and supply chain governance can lead to increased costs, affecting profitability.

Stakeholders, including customers, investors, and regulators, are increasingly concerned about companies' environmental impact and sustainability practices. Failing to address these concerns can lead to reputational damage and potential loss of business.\\n\\n5.

I can only answer things regarding: ['Table of Contents\\\\nto the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could\\\\ndamage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could\\\\nresult in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal\\\\nclaims.\\\\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal\\\\ndata privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states have enacted  comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on\\\\ncovered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As\\\\napplicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as\\\\ntargeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and\\\\nservices. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy\\\\nimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by\\\\nthe California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\\\\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional\\\\nviolation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\\\\nand local levels. Addition ally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products\\\\nand services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\\\\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also consid ering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted\\\\nthe General Data Protec tion Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of\\\\npersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively , including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose\\\\ndata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply , we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or\\\\n4% of worldwide revenue , whichever is greater , and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\\\\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to\\\\nchange our business practices.\\\\nIn the ordina ry course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain\\\\njurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of\\\\npersonal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly\\\\ntransfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdi ctions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the\\\\nUnited States. Additionally , the U.K.’ s Internatio nal Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K.\\\\nextension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify  compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms\\\\nthat may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However , these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is\\\\nno assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are\\\\nconsidering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of\\\\ndoing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’ s law impose s various requirements relating to data processing and data\\\\nlocalization. Data broadly defined as important under China’ s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment\\\\nand approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these require ments, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of\\\\nsuch assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The\\\\ninability to import person al data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties\\\\nthat are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe\\\\nand/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly\\\\nviolating the GDPR’ s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\\\\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligation s related to data privacy and security , and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or\\\\nmay be claim ed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual\\\\nrestrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal\\\\ndata, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action,  or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and\\\\nother statem ents, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security . If these policies, materials or\\\\nstatements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency , deceptive, unfair or misreprese ntative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation,\\\\nenforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\\\\n29', metadata={'source': 'docs/nvidia-document.pdf', 'page': 28})]']\", 'The percentage increase in operating income in FY2024 compared to the previous year was 38.5%.', 'NVIDIA attracts and retains talented employees, especially in the technical field, by growing its technical workforce, attracting global talent through a strong employer brand, implementing differentiated hiring strategies for various talent segments, and increasing focus on diversity recruiting.
